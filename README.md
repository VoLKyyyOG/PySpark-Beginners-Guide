# PySpark Beginner's Guide (Apache Spark 3.2)
A beginner's guide to Apache Spark 3.2 (PySpark). 

This is essentially (for now) just an updated version of my MAST30034 PySpark advanced tutorials, but will be reworked for a more general tutorial in future.

# Topics
1. Installation (Windows 10 + WSL2, Linux, MacOS)
2. Fundamentals (Spark Session, reading data in, filtering, aggregating, Spark SQL basics, saving data)
3. Pandas-on-Spark (Basics of PySpark's new pandas API as of Apache Spark 3.2)
4. Transformations and Functions (Conerting data types, creating User-Defined-Functions, and also pandas UDFs)
